	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: In December 2019, a novel strain of SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Wuhan, China. Since then, the city of Wuhan has taken unprecedented measures and efforts in response to the outbreak. METHODS: We quantified the effects of control measures on population contact patterns in Wuhan, China, to assess their effects on the progression of the outbreak. We included the latest estimates of epidemic parameters from a transmission model fitted to data on local and internationally exported cases from Wuhan in the age-structured epidemic framework. Further, we looked at the age-distribution of cases. Lastly, we simulated lifting of the control measures by allowing people to return to work in a phased-in way, and looked at the effects of returning to work at different stages of the underlying outbreak. FINDINGS: Changes in mixing patterns may have contributed to reducing the number of infections in mid-2020 by 92\% (interquartile range: 66-97\%). There are benefits to sustaining these measures until April in terms of reducing the height of the peak, overall epidemic size in mid-2020 and probability that a second peak may occur after return to work. However, the modelled effects of social distancing measures vary by the duration of infectiousness and the role school children play in the epidemic. INTERPRETATION: Restrictions on activities in Wuhan, if maintained until April, would likely contribute to the reduction and delay the epidemic size and peak, respectively. However, there are some limitations to the analysis, including large uncertainties around estimates of R0 and the duration of infectiousness.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementKP, YL, MJ, and PK were funded by the Bill \&amp; Melinda Gates Foundation (grant number INV-003174), YL and MJ were funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) (16/137/109), TWR and AJK were funded by the Wellcome Trust (grant number 206250/Z/17/Z), RME was funded by HDR UK (grant number MR/S003975/1), and ND was funded by NIHR (HPRU-2012-10096).This research was partly funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) (16/137/109) using UK aid from the UK Government to support global health research.

  abstract = {The ergodic hypothesis is a key analytical device of equilibrium statistical mechanics. It underlies the assumption that the time average and the expectation value of an observable are the same. Where it is valid, dynamical descriptions can often be replaced with much simpler probabilistic ones ---time is essentially eliminated from the models. The conditions for validity are restrictive, even more so for non-equilibrium systems. Economics typically deals with systems far from equilibrium ---specifically with models of growth. It may therefore come as a surprise to learn that the prevailing formulations of economic theory ---expected utility theory and its descendants ---make an indiscriminate assumption of ergodicity. This is largely because foundational concepts to do with risk and randomness originated in seventeenth-century economics, predating by some 200 years the concept of ergodicity, which arose in nineteenth-century physics. In this Perspective, I argue that by carefully addressing the question of ergodicity, many puzzles besetting the current economic formalism are resolved in a natural and empirically testable way.},

In this model, asset prices and their stochastic properties are determined endogenously. One principal result is a partial differential equation which asset prices must satisfy.

	Abstract = {Cooperation is needed for evolution to construct new levels of organization. The emergence of genomes, cells, multi-cellular organisms, social insects and human society are all based on cooperation. Cooperation means that selfish replicators forgo some of their reproductive potential to help one another. But natural selection implies competition and therefore opposes cooperation unless a specific mechanism is at work. Here I discuss five mechanisms for the evolution of cooperation: kin selection, direct reciprocity, indirect reciprocity, network reciprocity and group selection. For each mechanism, a simple rule is derived which specifies whether natural selection can lead to cooperation.},

In particular, we pay attention to the ergodic properties of these processes, i.e. the (non)equivalence of time and ensemble averages.},

@article{Burkhardt2007,
	Abstract = {In the random acceleration process considered here, a point particle is accelerated by Gaussian white noise with zero mean. Early work on first-passage and first-return probabilities and some recent applications are reviewed. Motion on the half line x > 0 and on the finite line0 < x < 1 is considered, with two types of boundary conditions, absorbing and inelastic. In colliding inelastically with the boundary, the kinetic energy of the particle decreases. Results for this boundary condition are of interest in connection with driven granular matter. Some applications to semiflexible polymers are discussed where the statistics is the same as for the randomly accelerated particle. Finally, an introduction to the extreme statistics of the random acceleration process is given.},

They find that the density of troughs vanishes in the thermodynamic limit and calculate the scaling of the trough density with L. This is dependent on a tuning parameter that controls the creation of new troughs. SOC, they claim, is a result of observing finite-size effects, a non-zero trough density that would be zero in the TD limit. Leo Kadanoff recommended this paper to me when I told him about AS things. It is indeed somewhat similar in that SOC is linked to a phase transition with normal tuning parameters. )},

It turns out that this one bit of information is sufficient to produce the same correlations that would be observed if the vectors Alice and Bob are sharing were fully quantum-entangled, i.e. Bell pairs. It's startling that only one bit is needed; does entanglement not make full use of the three-dimensional vector information?

The intervals themselves perform a modified random walk (modified so they don't diverge.) This paper was cited by Yano, Fraedrich, Blender as a possibility for generating 1/f noise such as observed in the variations of CAPE they reported in 2001. Didier pointed out that their mechanism for 1/f is trivial. The change of the intervals is a simple Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, and therefore the event times are given by an integral of a O-U process.},

Both adiabatic and reversible CAPE are considered, both are 1/f. They use detrended fluctuation ananlysis, like Nick in his thesis. At the end they make a very good case for thinknig about long-correlation CAPE processes, also instead of adding weird noise terms. Their data don't have high enough temporal resolution, and they also mention the problem of locality. They argue that it might not be so important, though (very end).},

All SOC mean fields are branching processes. This is argued in sec.I and developed in sec.II. In the presence of dissipation, there's a cut-off function whose argument depends on the level of dissipation as a power law. This type of scaling is assumed for size and duration of avalanches. The corresponding exponents are calculated in sec. IV. The self-organized branching process arises as a mean field description. This model has a critical point p* whose value varies with the level of dissipation. But the fixed point of the dynamics is always p=1/2. It follows that only for 0 dissipation the model is critical, otherwise it is subcritical. \tau and lifetime exponent are also calculated. The authors note that dissipation prevents criticality. {"the level of dissipation acts as a relevant parameter"} and leads to a sub-critical state. The mean field theory for SOC models is always a branching process, with activity being able to branch out or die. This leads to the same mean-field exponents for SOC, e.g. \tau=1.5.},

This system is then modelled with the 2d sandpile. The analogy to real sandpiles is also established. Note that the authors speak of DAMPED pendula. For the sandpile analogy they forget the necessity of friction (=damping). Numerical work reveals the avalanche size power law and that for avalanche lifetimes in 2s and 3d. Lifetimes are assumed to be related to the size by exponential spreading of activity in the cluster. They find p(s) ~ s^(-0.98).

For models with many absorbing states this is not necessarily true. There are counter-examples (branching annihilation walks and a model by Grassberger) that display non-DP critical behaviour. The author notes that in those cases the particle number is conserved modulo 2. This conservation law might lead to different behaviour. The paper gives a lot of references to original work on critical phenomena and papers relating to their applicability to non-equilibrium critical phenomena. Dickman's recipe for measuring the order parameter as a function of system size is used (start with a large ensemble, wait till the order parameter reaches a plateau, then take a time- and ensemble average). From the scaling of this quantity in L, \beta/\nu_(perp) is determined. This is consistent with the values for DP. Also \Theta=\beta/\nu_(parallel) is determined. \Theta describes the approach to the plateau, and \nu_(parallel) is the correlation length exponent in the time direction. plateau). T},

	Optnote = {This is a paper about Reggeon Field Theory. It is reported that the theory, though formulated like a quantum field theory, is rather a Markov process, called a ''Gribov process''. This Gribov process involves diffusion, absorption (X \to 0) of an entity, autocatalytic reproduction of entities (X \to 2X), the inverse of autocatalytic reproduction (2X \to X), and recombination (2X \to 0). This model is then put on a lattice by defining two processes: I)particles disappear at rate k and II) particles produce an offspring at a neighbouring site at rate k'. This constitutes an example of a Gribov process. Note that all Gribov steps can be reproduced with this simple model. There's also a Reggeon spin model which simply maps onto the same process by identifying up-spin with occupation (and vice versa). Note that all these models have one absorbing state: the vacuum. (This is pointed out in the paper, referring to the term ''absorbing state'' as Markov chain terminology.) The model is then studied analytically and numerically, obtaining scaling relations and exponents in agreement with published values for Reggeon theory. The numerical treatment is very thourough: Several different methods are used to find exponents, enabling consistency-checks. The model is then modified in several ways, e.g. always producing two offspings, if more than one particle appear at one site then they are deleted or replaced by one etc. None of these changes affect the critical behaviour. The authors speculate that since the investigated type of (discrete) RFT is apparently part of a large universality class, continuous RFT might also be part of it. There is no mention of the conjecture that all models with one absorbing state fall in the same universality class (that of directed percolation (DP)). Neither do the authors mention that RFT and DP are in the same universality class. This conjecture came later (in 1981/1982 by Janssen/ Grassberger respectively).},

I read this paper because Janssen's and Grassberger's are not available online. It talks about a model of adsorption of O_2 and CO on a surface. This model undergoes a secon-order phase transition into an absorbing state. The extension of the DP conjecture seems to be that models with many components (like O_2 and CO) still fall in the DP universality class because only one component at a time will be critical. Thus the other components can be 'integrated out of the problem' (page 4822).},

The relaxation rules are as in the original model, but the drive is different: A driving time step corresponds to increasing the slopes at all sites by dz until one site reaches its critical slope value and relaxes, triggering an avalanche (similar to OFC dynamics). In this case, it turns out that, although dz \propto L^{-1}, the energy added to the pile in each step scales as L^{2}. This can be calculated by considering the potential energy of a wedge added onto a slope (\propto L^3 dz). Thus stationarity demands <s> \propto L^2, i.e. we have the scaling law D(2-\tau)=2, which is satisfied by a change in \tau to 1.11. D is the same as in the original. The paper also investigates the universality of the oslo model. It can be mapped exactly onto a depinning model (this is not universality in my opinion, since it is an exact mapping). The mapping onto a 1-d OFC model requires a change of one boundary and a change in the relaxation rules (now always relax to 0 force). Still, the exponents of the original are unchanged in this case. The author interprets this as evidence for a large oslo universality class. The model he presents is not in the same universality class according to his definition, since \tau is different. One could argue that \tau is simply not a universal exponent and that instead D determines the universality class. This makes sense because D is very robust indeed. But the author doesn't take this view.},

Even worse, the avalanche size- and duration exponents are not well-defined in the BTW model. There's curvature in the respective moment index q vs. moment-exponent \sigma. A set of scaling relations between area, perimeter, radius, time, size are given meaning (e.g. area-perimeter is fractal dimension, time-radius is dynamical exponent z etc). It is argued in this paper that \tau is given by the position in the q-axis where \sigma(q) intercepts it plus 1. This can be calculated easily. The intercept is called (capital) \Sigma. Again, universality is understood as equality of all critical exponents. There's a warning in here to look at more than only the size moments. Also, the moment analysis is argued to be less accurate than a direct regression of the power law. A lot of interesting references in here: real- and momentum space RG, Dhar's algebras for Manna and BTW. References for 'non-universal critical behaviour' (quote from the text).},
